Reallllllyyyyyy simple fix for the Mac Source Ports Version of vkQuake not working

Info:

-Makes a simple shell script that simply opens the app in way that doesn't cause the usual "Couldn't load gfx.wad" error
-Comes with .pkg for an easy install
-Needs only 1 command to work!•ᴗ•

How to install:
-run pkg
-open "MOS-Quake" in applications
-If u get an error relating to .command permissons run this in terminal "chmod +x /Applications/MOS-QUAKE.command"
-Hopefully everything works and now u can play Quake in peace yippee!!!!!
