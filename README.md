Info:                                 
-Makes a simple shell script that simply opens the app in way that doesn't cause the usual "Couldn't load gfx.wad" error                      
-Comes with .pkg for an easy install                                 
-Needs only 1 command to work!•ᴗ•

How to install:                                 
-run pkg                                 
-open "MOS-Quake" in applications                                 
-If u get an error relating to .command permissons run this in terminal "chmod +x /Applications/MOS-QUAKE.command"                                 
-Hopefully everything works and now u can play Quake in peace yippee!!!!!
